I am a conservation scientist with academic background in global change ecology, biogeography and environmental science. I specialize in applied satellite remote sensing for global biodiversity conservation.

In addition to my academic work, I contribute regularly to public scholarship particularly on Palestine. You can find my papers and other writings on this page.
