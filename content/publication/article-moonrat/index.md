abstract: Commercial timber extraction and agricultural expansion lead to substantial degradation and loss of tropical rainforests, posing a severe threat to biodiversity in South-east Asia. Although the impacts of these disturbances are well understood for some species, they remain largely unknown for most species, impeding any directed conservation efforts. One of these little known, presumably forest-dwelling species is the moonrat Echinosorex gymnura, an insectivorous mammal ranging from southern Myanmar and southern Thailand to Sumatra and Borneo. While the moonrat is currently listed as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, large parts of its range have been severely degraded due to unsustainable logging practices and the conversion of forest to oil palm plantations. We conducted a systematic large-scale camera trap survey in three forest reserves under different forest management strategies in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We recorded a total of 67 independent moonrat detections at 22 of 180 camera trap stations over 12,281 camera trap days. We analysed moonrat habitat associations using occupancy modelling and a set of 9 different environmental covariates. Canopy closure and forest quality were positively associated with moonrat occurrence and were the most important determinants of the species’ occurrence in our study area. Proximity to plantations (oil palm and industrial timber) and elevation negatively affected moonrat occurrence. Our results thus indicate that the moonrat strongly depends on high-quality lowland forest and is unlikely to occur close to plantations. Moonrat occupancy was highest in the sustainably managed forest reserve, suggesting that this species responds much better to reduced-impact logging compared to conventional logging practices. Our first ecological survey indicates that the moonrat may be more threatened by the continued conversion, degradation, and fragmentation of tropical lowland rainforests than previously assumed.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: Avian biodiversity in agricultural landscapes is declining globally. In Europe and America, agricultural homogenization and the decline of smallholder farming are key drivers of bird population declines. In South Asia, large expanses of compositionally diverse agricultural landscapes still exist. Yet, how resident and migratory avian populations respond to landscape composition and configuration on wintering grounds is largely unknown. Leveraging recent advances in remote sensing, we mapped landscape composition and configuration to analyze their impacts on resident and migratory birds in agriculture–savanna mosaics of western India.
