abstract: Intensively managed viticulture dominates vast landscapes in the Mediterranean, but considerable vineyard abandonment has been observed over the past two decades. The effect of vineyard abandonment on biodiversity is poorly understood, making it difficult to assess the restoration potential of this common land-use change. We assessed biodiversity responses to vineyard abandonment in Vaucluse, Southern France, using birds as indicator group. We compared bird abundance and diversity in a sample of 64 vineyards, pairing 16 currently managed vineyards with 16 recently abandoned and 16 managed with 16 longer abandoned vineyards. We used mixed models and multivariate techniques to establish relationships between bird diversity and structural attributes of the habitats, and we derived management-specific population densities in a distance sampling approach.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: Avian biodiversity in agricultural landscapes is declining globally. In Europe and America, agricultural homogenization and the decline of smallholder farming are key drivers of bird population declines. In South Asia, large expanses of compositionally diverse agricultural landscapes still exist. Yet, how resident and migratory avian populations respond to landscape composition and configuration on wintering grounds is largely unknown. Leveraging recent advances in remote sensing, we mapped landscape composition and configuration to analyze their impacts on resident and migratory birds in agricultureâ€“savanna mosaics of western India.
